I saw https://robustirc.net/[RobustIRC] mentioned today in a Lobste.rs
https://robustirc.net/[post] by the author of i3. It's IRC over Raft, supposed
to make it easy to run an IRC network while doing regular ops work on the
servers. I want to play with this and at least get it to run on localhost,
probably through Docker compose. It needs an SSL certificate and a DNS record
for each host in the network, so it's probably worth it to document how to set
it up.
