:keywords: profiling, sqlite, programming, c, go

Causal profiling (reference implementation
https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz[Coz])
is based on the idea that to find out the benefits of profiling, it is
equivalent to speed up a section of a program and to slow down all other
sections. This https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2815400.2815409[paper] and
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE0V-p1odPg&t=0m28s[video] talk about the idea in
detail and show its use on real programs like sqlite.

The reference implementation is for C. The idea has been ported to some other
languages:
