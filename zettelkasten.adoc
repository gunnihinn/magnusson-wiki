The breathlessly named lobste.rs post
https://lobste.rs/s/syoikp/zettelkasten_how_one_german_scholar_was[Zettelkasten:
How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive] answers its own question by
explaining said German scholar's productivity system. It was a set of ideas on
index cards, organized by tags, with links between cards. Apparently, given
enough of these, one can generate new ideas by going on random walks through
relevant sections of the idea set.

The "Freakishly Productive" part refers to that said German scholar -- Niklas
Luhmann -- wrote over 70 books and 400 research papers over his life. While
impressive, one wonders whether this is a case of people raised on content
monetization valuing quantity over quality.
