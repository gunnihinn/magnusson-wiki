This wiki is a collection of notes. It's got tags which makes it a kind of
link:zettelkasten.html[Zettelkasten], I guess.

Each note is an https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide[Asciidoc]
document. It's got a description list called "tags" with a bullet list of
tags. A note can link to other notes as `${filename}.html`.
