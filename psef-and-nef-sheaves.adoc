= Pseudo-effective and numerically flat reflexive sheaves

One of my math siblings has a https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14676[paper] out where
they prove that pseudo-effective bundles over compact Kahler manifolds with zero
first Chern class are actually numerically effective.

They do this by taking a singular hermitian metric on the canonical line bundle
of the projective bundle of the vector bundle they care about. If its
singularities are controlled well enough, they can push powers of that metric
down, thus getting closed positive currents that represent the Segre classes of
the bundle. By some hardcore theorems of Demailly, this implies that the bundle
is nef by taking limits of those currents.
